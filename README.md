Data Cleaning: Removes duplicates and standardizes values in columns like 'Marital Status', 'Gender', 'Age brackets', and 'Commute Distance'.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates insightful visualizations, including charts for average income by gender and purchase data, count of purchased items based on age brackets, and count of purchased items based on commute distance.
